Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The cliet was DriverPass. They wanted a website to pick packages, take practice exams/tests, schedule driving pracitice, and generally help prepare students for the drivers exam. 
What did you do particularly well?
I think I did well designing the UML diagrams. 
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise a document I would revise UML class diagram of the system design document. I think it doesn't truly represent the code that would be needed to create this system. Looking at other examples I may have missed other objects.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The clients were very clear on what they wanted. I had to break down their demands though into manageable blocks and take their demands one at a time. It is so important to consider user's needs because they determine the effectiveness and efficiency of the system. They can dictate what the customer demands actually look like. The users are the ones that have to use the product and if it fails them then they will go elsewhere. 
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software one part at a time. I try to test and go through the software over and over until I'm satisfied or the prompt is satisfied. Feedback will be a huge part of my strategy in the future. Because feedback is important to building a better code.
